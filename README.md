# MYPuTTY

Manipulate PuTTY session configurations

## Overview

Using PowerShell to configure session information is particularly handy
to automate generation of PuTTY sessions, and initiate connections to
one or more of these sessions via the command line.

## Installation

Eventually an Install-Module MYPuTTY from PSGallery will be supported.
Until then, the Output directory, as described below in the development
section can be used to install the module.

## Development of MYPuTTY

Development is done using VS Code, and the github repository contains
tasks.json generated by the stucco plaster template. The build task will
generate an Output directory (ignored by git), containing a MYPuTTY directory
tree which can be deployed to a PSModulePath location.

## Examples

```powershell
PS> Get-MYPuttySession    # get all PuTTY sessions defined for the current user
PS> New-MYPuttySession -Name 'ubuntu-1804' -Template 'BlackOnPink' -HostName '192.168.1.11'
```
